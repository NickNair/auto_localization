With the use of the ROS framework the basic functionalitiesof mapping,localization and navigation shallbe achieved for an Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR).In the real world scenario,there are a number ofissues which are not completely handled in the widelyavailable open source modules.The following scenariois an example for the same.Whenever an AMR is powered on within a known environment(with map), the first step islocalization.That is informing the AMR it’s currentlocation with reference to the existing map.Basedonhow good the initial localization estimation is,thefurther navigational performance varies.Hence thisis avery important step for any AMR .But doing a manual localization every time could bea tedious task.So why don’t we think of a betteralternative?Which could auto localize itself fromthe last known position.So here comes the problemstatement.The candidate is ex
